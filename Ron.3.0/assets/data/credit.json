I am Doyne, and I came here to look for help on my new mod.\n\nPresenting FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN VS DOUYHE CORRUPTION: EXPANDED!\n\nThis mod will feature 7501 NEW WEEKS, featuring old and new characters, totalling up to 1859 SONGS! (Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll make those). Weâ€™re also adding a brand new original mechanic for each new week, which means thereâ€™s 800 MECHANICS in this one mod! Thatâ€™s crazy, right? Weâ€™re also going to add a hub world, a mission system and 900+ ACHIEVEMENTS for you to collect, all on a brand new engine made specifically for the mod!\n\nOf course, I will need a LOT of people to finish the mod. Unfortunately, I am a minor and cannot pay you guys, so this will all be for free. You will be paid with exposure on my channel with 98 subscribers, though.\n\nWe need the following people:\n\nArtists ( 1 / 1000 ) â€“ Seeing as this mod will have 800 weeks, we need artists for the backgrounds, character animations, and UI! Itâ€™ll need to be done in the FNF style, as Iâ€™m aiming to make this mod as accurate as possible.\n\nCoders ( 1 / 1000 ) â€“ Coding all of the features in will take a lot of people. You need to do this on your own game engine, as using existing engines isnâ€™t too fancy and I donâ€™t like it.\n\nMusicians ( 1 / 1000 ) â€“ Yes, Iâ€™m doing the music, but Iâ€™ll also need a bunch of people to do the vocals for the songs (I use a mobile app to do music). Also, 2400 songs is a lot, so assistance would be nice!\n\nVoice Actors ( 1 / 100 ) â€“ The original game has voice actors for the vocals, so we will too! You only need to voice all of the fully animated cutscenes and give the vocal artists samples.\n\nDM me if youâ€™re interested. Remember, this is all for free because Iâ€™m a minor",
